## 🔧 Installation & Requirements

HASHMON is a Python-based terminal utility. You only need Python 3.8+ and a few lightweight libraries to get started.

### ✅ Requirements

- Python **3.8 or higher**
- Required modules:
  - `colorama`
  - `pyfiglet`
  - `tkinter` *(comes built-in with most Python installations)*

---

### ⚙️ Install Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the required modules:

```bash
pip install colorama pyfiglet
```

> ⚠️ Make sure Tkinter is installed and working on your system.
> On some Linux distros, you may need to install it manually:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

### 📥 Clone & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mono404Fun/HASHMON.git
cd HASHMON
python hashmon.py
```

That's it. You're ready to go. 💥

## 🚦 Usage & Features

HASHMON is fully interactive — just run it in your terminal and follow the prompts.  
It offers two major features:

---

### 1️⃣ Convert Plain Text to Hash

Choose this option to convert any string into a cryptographic hash using your selected algorithm.

#### 🔤 Example:
```shell
Choose an option from the list [Ex: 1] >>> 1
Enter plain text [Ex: Hello, world!] >>> password123
Choose a hashing algorithm >>> SHA-256
```

#### 🔎 Output:
```shell
Hash: ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f
Hash Length: 64 characters
Execution Time: 0.0002 seconds
Algorithm Description: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function producing a 256-bit hash value.
```


---

### 2️⃣ Bruteforce a Hash using Wordlist

Choose this option to attempt reversing a hash by comparing it against a wordlist.

#### 📂 Steps:
- Open a wordlist (`.txt`) using the file browser
- Enter the hash to crack
- Select the corresponding hashing algorithm

#### 🔤 Example:
```shell
Choose an option from the list [Ex: 2] >>> 2
Open a wordlist file...
Enter hash >>> 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
Choose algorithm >>> MD5
```

#### ✅ Output:
```shell
Hash value found: password123
Execution Time: 0.0124 seconds
```


> ❌ If not found, HASHMON will notify you that the value doesn't exist in the wordlist.

---

All output is color-coded and clear — optimized for fast use, readability, and fun.

## 🔐 Supported Hashing Algorithms

HASHMON supports a wide variety of modern and legacy cryptographic hash algorithms.  
Each one comes with a built-in description for better understanding.

| Algorithm     | Description                                                                                      |
